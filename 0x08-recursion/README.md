# Tasks
- File 0: a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. The standard library provides a similar function: puts.
- File 1: a function that prints a string in reverse.
- File 2: a function that returns the length of a string.
- File 3: a function that returns the factorial of a given number. Factorial of 0 is 1
- File 4: a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. The standard library provides a different function: pow.
- File 5: a function that returns the natural square root of a number. The standard library provides a different function: sqrt.
- File 6: a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
- File 7: a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. An empty string is a palindrome.
- File 8: a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. s2 can contain the special character * The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
