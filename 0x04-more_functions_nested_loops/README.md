# C - More functions, more nested loops
The project contains:
- Nested while loops
- C functions
- Prototypes (included in the header files and included in the code block 'main.c')
- Header files (main.h)

# Tasks

- File 0: a function that checks for uppercase characters and runs similarly to the "isupper" fucntion.
- File 1: a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).The standard library "isdigit" provides a similar function.
- File 2: a function that multiplies two integers.
- File 3: a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- File 4: a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line and skips '2' & '4'
- File 5: a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
- File 6: a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed, ends with a new line.
- File 7: a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed, The diagonal should end with a \n. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n
- File 8: a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line, Using the character # to print the square.
- File 9: a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
- File 10: a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
