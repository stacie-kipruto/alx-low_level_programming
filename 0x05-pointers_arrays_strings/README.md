# C - Pointers, arrays and strings
Low level programming exercises on pointers, arrays and strings

# Files and what they contain:
- File 0-reset_to_98.c: A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- File 1-swap.c: a function that swaps the values of two integers.
- File 2-strlen.c: a function that returns the length of a string.
- File 3-puts.c: a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
- File 4-print_rev.c: a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line
- File 5-rev_string.c: a function that reverses a string
- File 6-puts2.c: a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- File 7-puts_half.c: a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. The function should print the second half of the string, If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
- File 8-print_array.c: a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line, where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed, Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space, numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
- File 9-strcpy.c: a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest, Return value: the pointer to dest
