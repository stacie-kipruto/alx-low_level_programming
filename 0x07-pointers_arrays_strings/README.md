# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

- File 0: a function that fills memory with a constant byte. Runs similarly with the function memset.
- File 1: a function that copies memory area. Runs similarly with the function memcpy
- File 2: a function that locates a character in a string. Runs similarly as the function strchr.
- File 3: a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. Runs similarly as strspn
- File 4: a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. The standard library provides a similar function: strpbrk
- File 5: a function that locates a substring. The standard library provides a similar function: strstr
- File 6: a function that prints the chessboard.
- File 7: a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
- File 8: a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
- File 101: a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
